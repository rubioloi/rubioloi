# Hi, I am IÃ±igo ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŽ“ I am a PhD student in Ecology at Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences.
ðŸ¦¥ As a researcher, I mainly focus on biogeography, ecology and evolution. I like to use various tools and approaches to address eco-evolutionary questions related to the structure and functioning of ecosystems.
One of my interests is to study biodiversity patterns of macroscopic ðŸ¦¦ and microscopic ðŸ¦  organisms across different scales.
